# Gooey Swipe

Give your menus the feeling they're actually being dragged out until they pop into place.

Based on the work by [Eustache Thomas](https://github.com/Thomaseustache/swipe-menu-svg-v2) as a rebound to Jakub Antal√≠k's [Sidebar Animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/1949368-Sidebar-animation) Dribbble shot.

### Roadmap
- Convert this to a better swipe library
- Refactor
- Convert to extensible jQuery plugin
